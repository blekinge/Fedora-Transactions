/**
 * Provides a workaround to the fact that
 * {@link java.io.File.renameTo(java.io.File)} doesn't work across NFS file
 * systems.
 * <p>
 * This code is taken from a workaround provided on the Sun Developer Network
 * Bug Database (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4073756), by
 * mailto:morgan.sziraki@cartesian.co.uk
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The code is modified to protect against a situation where
 * <ul>
 * <li>We need to copy the file across NFS mounted filesystems</li>
 * <li>Another process is waiting for the file to be renamed</li>
 * </ul>
 * If we do a simple copy, we leave open the possibility that the second process
 * will see the new file created before we have a chance to copy the contents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To avoid this, we create the new file with a modified filename (prefixed by
 * an underscore '_'). When the copying is complete, we rename the file to the
 * desired name. This rename is within a directory, and therefore does not
 * extend across NFS filesystem boundaries, so it should work!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Modify again to make sure that neither the destination file nor the temp file
 * exist - throw an exception if they do. We can't rename on top of an existing
 * file.
 * </p>
