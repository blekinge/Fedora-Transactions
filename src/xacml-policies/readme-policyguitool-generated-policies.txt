[this readme-policyguitool-generated-policies.txt file is copied on server startup into the 
directory for user-generated policies]

This directory is reserved for repository-wide policies which are programmatically-generated,
but through user action, e.g., by Fedora Policy Tool.  The program which created any policies 
in this directory likely will treat them as write-only, i.e., any persistent storage which it 
uses to edit these policies will be different from the copies in this directory.
So any hand-edit changes could be lost on the next machine re-creation.

Bottomline:  consider carefully what you're doing before hand-editing these policies!
