      <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Fedora servlet security filters</h2>
      
      <p>
        We here assume that you have already installed Fedora, in either quick or custom varieties.
        This document gives advice on using Fedora's servlet security filters and its surrogate
        feature.  These filters authenticate Fedora users and/or provide user attributes to use in
        XACML authorization.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Fedora's servlet security filters are configured in the web deployment descriptor file
        (web.xml), typically in Fedora's webapp directory in whatever servlet container
        (e.g., Tomcat) you've deployed Fedora in. Section "Specifying Filter Configuration" in
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/Filters.html">The Essentials of Filters</a>
        discusses the format of specifying filters and filter-mappings and gives more information on
        the format of the servlet filter section of web.xml.   (That section does not have an anchored
        location to link to directly.)  It may be helpful to use the Fedora web.xml as guide while
        reading this document.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Fedora installer will have configured several servlet filters in the correct order.
        Leave these in the order given, with the filter elements grouped first, and then the grouped
        filter-mapping elements following as a second group.  Within either filter or filter-mapping
        unit, the filter definitions are ordered:  SetupFilter, XmlUserfileFilter,
        (LdapFilterForAttributes), (LdapFilterForGroups), EnforceAuthnFilter, FinalizeFilter.  The
        filters in parenthesis are optional, and won't be installed by default.  Again, retain this
        order and if you add a filter, use the place indicated.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The filter-mappings of the EnforceAuthnFilter determine which Fedora urls require user
        authentication.  The installer will set up these various mappings either for api-m alone
        or for both api-m and api-a urls/servlets.  You can customize web.xml for this, likely by
        adding or deleting mappings for this filter, if you need and know.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Parameter settings are specific to a servlet filter, and are given below for the Fedora
        servlet security filters. Here is the format which the specification takes in web.xml:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &lt;filter&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-name&gt;LdapFilterForAttributes&lt;/filter-name&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-class&gt;fedora.server.security.servletfilters.ldap.FilterLdap
        &lt;/filter-class&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;init-param&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;param-name&gt;authenticate&lt;/param-name&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>. . .</strong>
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/init-param&gt;
        <br/>
        &lt;/filter&gt;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Use this format to define in web.xml the parameter settings you need.
      </p>

        If you are setting up this filter, use "LdapFilterForAttributes" as filter-name,

        choose values from the parameters below which fit your Ldap directory configuration
        for reading user <em>attributes</em>. You can also use parameters for either/both
        Ldap authentication/binding and/or the surrogate feature, as explained elsewhere in
        this document. You may need to talk to your directory administrator to find out
        these settings.

      <p>
        The surrogate feature supports end-user authentication by a Fedora client or web
        server front-end.  The surrogate user is represented in the request directly
        (in the usual header) and is authenticated by Fedora as usual.  A From: header holds
        the identity of the represented virtual user.

    <h2 id="authz">Authorization via XACML</h2>
    
    <p>
      Fedora 2.0 hardcoded minimal authorization constraints, beyond those provided by
      specifications in Tomcat's web.xml file. Fedora 2.1.1 instead exposes these to customization
      by encoding them in the XACML standard.  A complete description can be found in the
      documentation for the <a href="AuthorizationXACML.htm">Fedora Authorization with XACML
      Policy Enforcement</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Default Repository Policies</h3>
    
    <p>
      Fedora 2.1.1 ships with a set of <a href="AuthorizationXACML.htm#default"> default
      repository-wide XACML policies</a> that approximate the minimal security level provided
      by Fedora 2.0.&nbsp; This set of repository-wide policies includes the following policies:
    </p>
    
    <h3>Custom Policies</h3>
    
    <p>
      Note that the default repository policies enforce a minimal level security (e.g.,
      API-A is totally unrestricted).&nbsp; If you need a more customized level of access
      control what is provided by the default, you will need to add additional repository-wide
      policies or individual object-specific policies to customize your access environment.
      Refer to the <a href="XACMLPolicyGuide.htm">Fedora XACML Policy Writing Guide</a>
      document for more information about how to construct policies for your repository.

    <h2 id="stepByStep">Step-By-Step Guide to Securing Your Repository</h2>
    
    <p>
      Here is a brief step-by-step guide that describes what you will need to do to configure
      your fedora repository. It is recommended that you start with the new installer and one
      of the base security configurations it creates and set of default policies and become
      familiar with the new installation and default security features of Fedora 2.2. Then you
      can go back and experiment with customizing various aspects of your repository
      configuration and policies.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a base security configuration by running "fedora-2.2.1-installer.jar"
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally customize fedora.fcfg for your repository
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally customize XACML policies (repository-wide and object-specific policies)
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally customize fedora-users.xml for your repository and users
      </li>
      <li> 
        Optionally customize web.xml to use servlet filters for authentication and user
        attributes
      </li>
      <li>
        Start the fedora server
