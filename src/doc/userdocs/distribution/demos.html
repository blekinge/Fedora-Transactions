          This manual describes the demonstration objects that are distributed with
          the Fedora open-source repository software. These objects can be loaded into
          the repository in one of two ways. The xml source files can be "ingested"
          into the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt,
          run: fedora-admin). Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other
          demos by running the demo load script (from the command prompt, run: fedora-ingest-demos
          [hostname] [port] [username] [password] [protocol]). The demo object
          source xml files for the demo objects can be found in the following directory:
          <strong>[FEDORA_HOME]/client/demo</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>There are two categories of demonstrations:</h3>
        </span>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Server Demos</strong> - These demos can be run under
            any conditions. They are intended to work when the Fedora repository
            server is in a stand-alone condition, for example, if the repository
            is running without a network connection, or if the repository is
            behind a firewall and not set up to receive outside connections.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Open Server Demos</strong> - These demos can only be run if
            the Fedora repository server is running as a network accessible
            server, meaning that it can make outgoing connections AND accept
            incoming connections.  If the repository server is running behind a
            firewall, the firewall must be configured to allow incoming
            connections on the port that the repository server is running. The
            Open Server Demos use distributed content and services that are
            remote to the repository server.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <span class="plaintext">
            Once demo objects are ingested into the repository, they can be viewed via a
            web browser using API-A-LITE or API-A. Remember the URL syntax to get the object
            profile via API-A-LITE is : http://{hostname}:{port}/fedora/get/{objectPID}. For
            example:
            <code class="block">
<pre>http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/demo:5
</pre>

              <li><strong>Simple Document Demo</strong> - This Fedora data object (objectPID is
              demo:18) demonstrates the simplest Fedora digital object scenario.
              It is the case where we aggregate content in the Fedora object, and
              let Fedora's default object behaviors provide access to the content.
              This is an example of a Fedora digital object that only has default
              dissemination services.  In this case, there are 3 datastreams in the object,
              one for each format of a particular document (in this case the
              Fedora paper presented at ECDL2002).  We can use the basic Fedora
              object dissemination service (also called "datastream disseminations")
              which are part of the basic content model shared by all objects.  The basic
              content model is dynamically associated with every object in the
              repository (though it may optionally be statically associated).
              It has a default service definition (sDep) which provides basic operations
              for every object which includes
              the ability to list items in the object, get an item, get the
              dissemination index, get the Dublin Core record, and retrieve other information
              about the object.  The results of these operations can be returned as
              either HTML (method names begin with "view...") or XML (method names
              begin with "get...").   The end result is that the object is simply
              a container for content and metadata.  The user can view the
              contents and get any item from the object.  While this scenario may
              be easy to implement and useful, it does not take advantage of
              Fedora's extensible service features where custom operations can be
              associated with an object.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Simple Image Demo</strong> - The Fedora data object (objectPID is
              demo:5) demonstrates the UVA Simple Image behaviors by associating a
              simple dissemination with the object through its content model.
              There are 4 Datastreams in the object, one for each of four different
              image resolutions.  The object is linked to one dissemination service which
              provides four behavior methods: getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium,
              and getThumbnail.  The fulfillment of the service contract entails the
              Fedora HTTP Image Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for
              each of the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no transformations
              performed on the datastreams.  This object shows how a service
              definition can be used to create a normalized set of methods for a
              particular type of object, an image object in this case, which is defined by a
              content model. The idea here is that the Simple Image service definition
              provides a standard set of dissemination services that can be used on any image
              object that conforms to the standard image content model.  As
              we will see later, different variants of image objects can subscribe
              to the same service definition, and in some cases the datastreams
              will be dynamically transformed by a service to provide the
              appropriate image disseminations.  This demo shows a simple
              one-to-one mapping of the datastreams in the object to the behavior
              methods.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Document Transformation Demo</strong> - The Fedora data object
              (objectPID is demo:14) demonstrates the Document Transformation
              behaviors.  There are 3 datastreams in the object, one XML source
              document, and two XSLT stylesheets.  The object's content model provides
              one dissemination service which is associated with the "Document Transform" service
              definition and the Fedora Local Saxon Service (service deployment).  Two
              services are available: getDocumentStyle1 and getDocumentStyle2.
              When these methods are run the repository
              mediates access to the Fedora Local Saxon Service to produce the
              appropriate transformation on the XML source in the object.  The
              dissemination result will be one of two document styles.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Image Collection Demo</strong> - This demo illustrates the use of
              the Resource Index search service to fulfill collection behaviors.
              <em>For this demo to work, the
              <a href="../server/resourceIndex/index.html">Resource Index
              module</a> must be enabled prior to ingesting these objects.</em>
              <br />
              <br />
              A series of data objects (demo:SmileyBucket, demo:SmileyKeychain,
              etc.) subscribe to the image behaviors defined by the sDef object
              demo:DualResImage.  Each of these image objects also use the
              RELS-EXT datastream to assert its membership in the
              demo:SmileyStuff collection.  The demo:SmileyStuff collection
              subscribes to sDef object demo:Collection, which defines two
              methods: list and view.  The collection object uses the
              demo:DualResImageCollection sDep to implement those behaviors.
              <br />
              <br />
              To see the dynamic HTML listing of collection members in action,
              you can view http://hostname/fedora/get/demo:SmileyStuff/demo:Collection/view
              <br />
              <br />
              This dissemination first requests the list of members of the demo:SmileyStuff
              collection using the local
              <a href="../server/webservices/risearch/index.html">risearch service</a>.
              Then it uses the local
              <a href="../server/localservices/saxon/index.html">saxon service</a> to transform
              the XML results into a human-readable HTML page.  The query text and
              the stylesheet are both datastreams of the SmileyStuff collection
              and act as inputs to the list and view behaviors, respectively.

            These can be run in two ways.  The xml source files can be "ingested" into
            the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt, run:
            fedora-admin).  Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other demos by running
            the demo load script (from the command prompt, run:
            fedora-ingest-demos [hostname] [port] [username] [password]).
            </span>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Simple Image Demos</strong> - These Fedora data objects (objectPIDs
              are demo:6 and demo:7) demonstrate the UVA Simple Image behaviors
              by associating more complex disseminators with the objects. They
              also demonstrate how two objects with different kinds of
              datastreams can be made to fulfill the UVA Simple Image behavior
              contract.  The key thing to note here is that both the demo:6 and
              demo:7 objects provide disseminations which subscribe to the UVA
              Simple Image service definition.  However, they each use a
              different service deployment to fulfill the behavior
              contract. In the case of demo:7, we have an object with 4 image
              datastreams, one for each of four different image resolutions.
              In this object the  UVA ImageZoomer service is used to add value
              to the image datastreams at runtime.  When a behavior method is
              run, the UVA ImageZoomer service will be called upon to wrap the
              image in a Java applet that provides a standardized, zoomable
              viewer for the images.  No matter which UVA Simple Image behavior
              is run (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, getThumbnail), the
              applet is provided.  In the case of demo:6, we have an object
              with one image datastream, a wavelet-encoded MrSID file, which is
              passed through the UVA MrSID Service to produce results similar to
              those provided by the UVA ImageZoomer service.
              Each object's content model subscribes to the "UVA Simple
              Image" service definition but the services are provided by seperate
              service deployments such that the same four behavior methods are
              available (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).
              Another notable feature of the demo:6
              object is that it shows how XML metadata can be put in the object
              as datastreams too.  The XML metadata datastreams can be viewed
              via the Default Disseminator (run getItemIndex or viewItemIndex).
              A final important point about these demos is that the services
              contracted by the service deployment run remote from the repository.
              Both the UVA ImageZoomer service and the UVA MrSID Service run as web
              services at the University of Virginia.  These demonstrations show how
              Fedora objects can leverage distributed web services, and most
              importantly, now the Fedora repository system handles the
              mediation and binding to these services in a manner that is
              transparent to the user.
              <br/>
              <br />
              The Fedora object with objectPID demo:30 demonstrates the
              UVA Simple Image behaviors with yet another twist.
              There are 4 datastreams in the object, one for
              each of four different image resolutions.  The object is mapped
              to a single dissemination service using the "UVA Simple Image"
              service definition and uses the Fedora HTTP Image Getter service
              (service deployment). As on other objects, four behavior methods are available
              (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  The
              fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the Fedora HTTP
              Image Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for
              each of the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no
              transformations performed on the datastreams.  This object is
              almost identical to the Fedora object (objectPID of demo:5)
              created under the local-server-demos. The major distinction is
              that the datastreams for this object are of type "R" indicating
              that their external URLs are to be redirected by Fedora.  The
              Fedora server typically protects the true location of external
              datastreams by functioning as a proxy service, thereby not
              exposing the physical datastream locations stored in the Fedora
              objects. However, there are certain situations where users may
              not want Fedora to proxy the location of external datastreams.
              For example, streaming audio and video providers may provide
              special optimization and performance tuning designed to function
              with a direct connection between a web browser and the content
              provider. Another example is datastreams that are protected by
              HTTP Basic authentication. Fedora will provide its own
              authentication and access policy in a future release to handle
              access restrictions. In the interim, the redirected datastream
              type can be used to access external datastreams that are
              protected with Basic authentication. In the Fedora object in this
              example, all 4 datastreams are protected on the external web
              server using HTTP Basic authentication which requires a username
              and password in order to access the datastreams. When attempting
              to execute the disseminations for these datastreams, you will be
              prompted for a username and password. The required username and
              password is "fedora".
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Userinput Image Demos</strong> - These Fedora data objects
              (objectPIDs are demo:10 and demo:11) demonstrate the UVA
              Userinput Image behaviors by associating more complex
              services with the objects.  The UVA Userinput Image service
              definition was constructed as a demonstration to show how a
              service definition can allow for user input parameters at run
              time.  In this case, the service definition has two methods
              (getThumbnail and getImage).  The getImage method takes two user
              input parameters:  the size of the image (e.g., small, medium1,
              medium2) and whether to wrap the image in a zoomable applet (yes,
              no). The content models of both objects share this service definition
              and both use the same the UVA MrSID service.  Depending on what the user
              enters, the MrSID Service will derive the proper size of the
              image, and wrap it with a zoomable applet if the user requested.
              The UVA MrSID Service runs as web services at University of
              Virginia.  As with the Open Server Simple Image Demos, these
              demonstrations show how Fedora object can leverage distributed
              web services.
